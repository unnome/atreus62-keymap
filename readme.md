# Atreus62 Unnome's keymap

The Atreus62 Unnome's keymap is a keymap developed by Unnome. It is used for both home and work.

- _Mac/Linux support_: as unnome works with a mac but has linux at home, he added a key combination to switch effortlessly (TM) between the two OSs. The two modes are functionally equivalent.
- _Emoji support_: as unnome is italian, he needs to be expressive. Therefore emoji.
- _Coding layer_: unnome is a coder, therefore he needs to type lots of symbols. The coding layer helps him in doing so.
